# Readme

All the notes have been collated and converted to $\LaTeX$ for publication and the old Markdown notes are no longer up-to-date. 
For the updated set of notes, see [**Introduction_to_Java_Lecture_Notes_for_AP_Computer_Science.pdf**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AAUn6_nBy_NORsGnWk1wVckCTHtFXFeu/view?usp=sharing).
You can also order a paperback copy in color [here](https://www.lulu.com/shop/daniel-szelogowski/introduction-to-java/paperback/product-7pmkm2.html).
