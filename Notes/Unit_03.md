# Unit 3 - Boolean Expressions and *if* Statements
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

## Boolean Expressions and Conditions


### Conditional Operators
Java supports the following conditional/relational operators (use ONLY for primitive types, otherwise these will compare the memory address of an object):
* `==`: exactly equal to 
* `!=`: not exactly equal to
* `>`: greater than
* `<`: less than
* `>=`: greater than or equal to
* `<=`: less than or equal to


## Conditional (*if*) Statements
```java
int x = 5;
int y = 5;

if (x == y) {
  // The code between these curly braces will only run if x is exactly equal to y
  System.out.println("x and y are equal!");
}
```


### *if-else* Statements
```java
if (x > y) {
  // The code between these curly braces will only run if x is greater than y
} else {  // Otherwise...
  // The code between these curly braces will only run if x is less than or equal to y
}
```
